Run `thesis_main.do` for variable generation, and tables and figures, except the Krugman index and ECI map figures, which are generated with the Jupyter notebooks `krugman.ipynb` and `eci_map.ipynb`.  `complexity2.ipynb` executes the ECI computations manually without additional packages, per the method in ยง3. 

All data is in `stata/data`, with the exception of any data and shapefiles needed for the Jupyter notebooks, which are in `python`. Due to github size limitations, two data sets are not included here:
  1. `stata/data/country_hsproduct4digit_year.dta`
  2. `stata/data/OECD_REGION_ECONOM_GVA_pW_22032024210336896.csv`
