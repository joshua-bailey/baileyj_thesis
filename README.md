## joshua bailey - masters thesis - economic complexity and industrial policy

Run `thesis_main.do` to run variable generation, and generate tables and figures (bar the Krugman index and ECI map figures, which are generated with the Jupyter notebooks `krugman.ipynb` and `eci_map.ipynb`.  `complexity2.ipynb` executes the ECI computations manually, per the method in Section 3. 

All data is in `stata | data`. Due to github size limitations, two data sets are not included here:
  1. stata/data/country_hsproduct4digit_year.dta
  2. stata/data/OECD_REGION_ECONOM_GVA_pW_22032024210336896.csv
